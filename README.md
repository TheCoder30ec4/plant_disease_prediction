# Plant Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting plant diseases using machine learning models. The repository contains the necessary datasets, model files, and code to train and evaluate a plant disease prediction model.

## Repository Structure

- **Data_Set/**: Contains the datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **api/**: Includes the API code for deploying the model.
- **code/**: Consists of the scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Figures/**: Visualizations and model diagrams.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Required Python packages: listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheCoder30ec4/plant_disease_prediction.git
   cd plant_disease_prediction
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Training the Model**:
   ```bash
   python code/train_model.py
   ```
2. **Running the API**:
   ```bash
   python api/app.py
   ```

### Dataset

The dataset includes images of various plant leaves with different diseases. Ensure the dataset is properly structured before training the model.

## Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy in predicting plant diseases. Visualizations of model performance are available in the `Figures` directory.
